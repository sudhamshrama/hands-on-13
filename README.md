**Topological Sort:**
Topological sorting is used to order the nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in such a way that for every directed edge u -> v, node u comes before node v in the ordering. It's often used in scheduling tasks, resolving dependencies, and compiling.


**Depth-First Search (DFS):**
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's used to traverse or search through the nodes of a graph or tree, and it can be implemented recursively or iteratively.


**Kruskal's Algorithm:**
Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. It repeatedly adds the next lightest edge that does not form a cycle until all vertices are included.
